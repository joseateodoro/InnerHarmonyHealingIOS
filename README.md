## Proposal
### Android Version Of The Inner Harmony Healing App
- Android App
- IOS App
- Google Firebase Database 

### Software: Android App (InnerHarmonyHealing) 
&emsp;&emsp;Purpose: To enlighten and change prospective for users.
</br></br>

#### Login Page
&emsp;&emsp;On first launch the user will be sent here and prompted to _Sign in with email_ or _Sign in with Google_. If the user stays signed in and closes the app, it will auto-login the user on the next launch. This is handled by Firebase Authentication.
</br></br>

#### Home Page
&emsp;&emsp;On first launch, it shows the default layouts that the user can choose to change the mirror display to. These default layouts cannot be edited. After first launch, it shows the default and user created layouts (if any). These layouts are retrieved dynamically from the database when the page loads. Tapping on these layouts will set the mirror display to that layout. There is an _Add Layout_ button that will send the user to the _**Create/Edit Layouts Page**_
</br></br>

#### Dashboard / MyDesign Page (not-confirmed)
&emsp;&emsp;It shows the user created layouts similar to the _**Home Page**_. These layouts are retrieved dynamically from the database when the page loads. Tapping on a layout will open the _**Create/Edit Layouts**_ page.
</br></br>

#### Notifications Page
&emsp;&emsp; Shows any notifications sent to the user via admin to user or maybe in the future, "user to user" or being able to send posts to _**Home Page**_
</br></br>


#### Account & Settings Page
&emsp;&emsp;_About_ button shows some information about the project and the company email.</br>
&emsp;&emsp;_Settings_ button lets the user update profile and logout.
